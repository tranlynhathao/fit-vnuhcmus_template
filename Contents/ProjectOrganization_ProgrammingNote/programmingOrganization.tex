\subsection{Project organization}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Header files
    \begin{itemize}[label=-]
        \item SortWithTime.h: This file contains the declaration of all original sorting algorithms which are used to measure the time of each algorithm.
        \item SortWithComapre.h: This file contains the declaration of all sorting algorithms which are used to counting the number of comparisons of each algorithm.
        \item CommandLine.h: This file contains the declarations of below things:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Declare all commands  which can be used when executing the file exe
            \item Declare necessary functions to run the commands.
        \end{itemize}

        \item DataGenerator.h: This file contains the below things:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Declare the functions to generate data in different orders and different sizes.
            \item Declare the functions to read files to get data and write data into files.
            \item Declare the function to duplicate an array.
            \item Declare the functions to measure the time and counting the comparison of given algorithm.
            \item The given template and given function for the template.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Lib.h: This file contains all the necessary libraries.
    \end{itemize}
    \item .cpp files
    \begin{itemize}[label=-]
        \item The cpp files in folder contains all definitions of the functions that are declared in the header files. "main.cpp" contains the \texttt{main()} function.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Generative Text files
    \begin{itemize}[label=-]
        \item There are 5 input text files and 1 output text files which is created when running the commands. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{NOTE:} Using these text files is optional, and alternatively, you can create new files in this format.
